	// 1. manually set the pending bit for USART3 IRQ (interrupt request) in NVIC  (Nested Vector Interrupt Controller)
	// The NVIC is usually vendor specific
	// this is tightly coupled with the core of the processor to handle interrupts
	// in ARM design, NVIC can handle up to 240 configurable interrupts
	// our target IRQ number is 39
	// and we have interrupt pending handlers from NVIC_ISPR0 to NVIC_ISPR7 - each can store 32 bits
	// so we have to use NVIC_ISPR1 - as 39 exceeds the first 32 bits
	//
	// NOTE: this is not a real case scenario as this is set automatically by the peripheral
	// we are doing this here for demo and understanding purposes
	//
	// to get the bit position we need to set for NVIC_ISPR1, we have to modulo 32
	// so 39 % 32 = 7
	// we have to set the 7th bit position
	// we don't have to subtract 1 from this as the first bit in NVIC_ISPR1 (for IRQ32) would be 0 i.e 32 % 32

	//  the address of ISPR1 from generic user guide:
	// ISPR1 = ISPR0 + 4
	uint32_t* pISPR1 = (uint32_t*) (0xE000E200 + 4);

	// setting the 39th bit to 1
	*pISPR1 |= (1 << (USART_IRQ_NUMBER % 32));


	// 2. enable the URAT3 IRQ number in the NVIC
	// the ISR has to be enabled for any of the interrupts to take effect, or else it automatically goes into the pending state
	//
	//  the address of ISER1 from generic user guide:
	// ISPE1 = ISER0 + 4
	uint32_t* pISER1 = (uint32_t*) (0xE000E100 + 4);

	// setting the 39th bit to 1
	*pISER1 |= (1 << (USART_IRQ_NUMBER % 32));
